# Heart-Beat Sensor

- Electrocardiography is one of the precise and popular ways to measure heart rate in the medical field. Monitoring heart rate is essential for athletes and patients to determine the heart condition. 

- With advancements in technology, a heartbeat sensor is an easy and smart way to measure heart rate. The sensors can be installed in wristwatches, smartphones, and chest strips to check on a person's heart rate. 

## Principle of Heartbeat Sensor
> Photoplethysmography is a principle that measures the changes in the volume of blood in an organ. It does this by measuring the changes in the intensity of the light passing through the organ. This principle works behind the working of the Heartbeat Sensor. 

> An IR LED is generally taken to be the light source in the heartbeat sensor, and photodetectors like Photo Diode, Photoresistor, or an LDR can be used. 
 
> It is possible to arrange the components, i.e., the light source and photodetector, in two ways: 

**Transmissive Sensor**: In this, the light source and detector face each other. The patient must place their finger between the transmitter and the receiver. 
**Reflective Sensor**: In this arrangement, the light source and the detector are adjacent to each other. The finger of the person is placed in front of the sensor to read the heartbeat rate.
