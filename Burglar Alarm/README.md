# Burglar Alarm
## AIM:
To Ring the Bell As Soon As Somebody's Movement Is Observed

## Purpose:
To Protect the Place From Burglar

## Short Description:
**Requirements:**
- Arduino UNO
- Potentiometer
- Push Button
- PIR Sensor
- Speaker
- Light Bulb
(Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:
- First we initialise Sensor , AlarmCounter , Buzzer Pin , Interrupt Pin.
- We initiate a Conditional statement For the Alarm to Ring When the Particular Sensitivity value is reached.
- A Resistor (1 Kohm) is added For the Push Button.

A Burglar alarm using Arduino gate such that the alarm should turn on whenever light falling on the Sensor is disrupted. The PIR sensor looks at the movement id there are any movement detected then the alarm will ring and the sensitivity of the alarm can be changed using the dailer. To Turn Off the alar there is a push button.

## Setup instructions:

- Open Tinker Cad on any browser and make the circuit as shown here.
- Then paste the code in code section.
- Open the Serial Monitor.
- Start Simulation.
- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Upload the code provided [here](Burglar_alarm.ino)
- Run to see the project in action!
