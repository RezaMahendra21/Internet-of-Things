# Alternate LED Blinking
## AIM:
To blink LEDs alternatively using arduino

## Purpose:
Each LED stays on for 1 second alternatively.

## Short Description:
**Requirements:**
- Arduino UNO
- 2 LEDs
- USB
(Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:
- First we initialise both the LEDs to a specific voltage
- We initiate a loop
- A delay is added so that blinking is visible

## Setup instructions:
- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Make sure to connect one end of both LEDs to ground(i.e. GND)
- Upload the code provided [here](https://github.com/pragyakhanna11/IoT-Spot/blob/main/Arduino/Alternate%20LED%20Blinking/alternate_led_blinking.ino)
- Run to see the project in action!
