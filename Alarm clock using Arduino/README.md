# Aim
To set the alarm and clock timing.
<br>

# Purpose
To ring the alarm and clock timing.
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
LCD 16 x 2 
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Potentiometer 250 kilo-ohms
Piezo
Slideswitch
Pushbutton
LED
<br>


# Workflow
We have completed the setup as per the given images mnetioned in the '/images/'<br>
We take the input for the alarm in HH:MM:SS format and the when the clock timing is matched to alarm it buzzer's as well as blinks LED, we can also change the clock timings as per the requirement. For demonstration purpose we have taken input using pushbutton for setting up alarm and clock generates buzzer for same.
