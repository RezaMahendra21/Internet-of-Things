# Automatic DOOR BELL
## AIM:
Automatic DoorBell Circuit Simulation in Timker Cad.

## Purpose:
To Ring the Bell As Soon As Somebody's Finger Gets Close To The Switch.

## Short Description:
**Requirements:**
- Arduino UNO
- LCD 16X2
- PIR Sensor
- Speaker/Door Bell
(Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:
- First we initialise Signal PIN, Buzzer Pin.
- We initiate a Conditional statement For the Buzzer to Ring
- A Resistor (1 Kohm) is added For the LCD

A DoorBell alarm using Arduino such that the alarm should turn on whenever light falling on the PIR is disrupted. The PIR sensor looks at the movement id there are any movement detected then the alarm will ring and the sensitivity of the alarm can be changed using in the code. There is No requiremnt of any switches.

## Setup instructions:
- Open Tinker Cad on any browser and make the circuit as shown here.
- Then paste the code in code section.
- Open the Serial Monitor.
- Start Simulation.
- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Upload the code provided [here]()
- Run to see the project in action!
